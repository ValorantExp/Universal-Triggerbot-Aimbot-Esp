⚙️ Configurable Settings
*Default settings are generally great for most scenarios. Check out the comments in the code for more insights. 🔍 The configuration settings are now located in the config.py file!
CAPS_LOCK is the default for flipping the switch on the autoaim superpower! ⚙️ 🎯

useMask - Set to True or False to turn on and off 🎭

maskWidth - The width of the mask to use. Only used when useMask is True 📐

maskHeight - The height of the mask to use. Only used when useMask is True 📐

aaQuitKey - The go-to key is q, but if it clashes with your game style, swap it out! ⌨️♻️

headshot_mode - Set to False if you're aiming to keep things less head-on and more centered. 🎯➡️👕

cpsDisplay - Toggle off with False if you prefer not to display the CPS in your command station. 💻🚫

visuals - Flip to True to witness the AI's vision! Great for sleuthing out any hiccups. 🕵️‍♂️✅

aaMovementAmp - The preset should be on point for 99% of players. Lower the digits for smoother targeting. Recommended doses: 0.5 - 2. ⚖️🕹️

confidence - Stick with the script here unless you're the expert. 🧐✨

screenShotHeight - Same as above, no need for changes unless you've got a specific vision. 📏🖼️

screenShotWidth - Keep it constant as is, unless you've got reasons to adjust. 📐🖼️

aaDetectionBox - Default's your best bet, change only if you've got the know-how. 📦✅

onnxChoice - Gear up for the right graphics card—Nvidia, AMD, or CPU power! 💻👾

centerOfScreen - Keep this switched on to stay in the game's heart. ❤️🖥️
